The month of training in the incubator ended with independent work. The task was this:
1. Write a counter that counts up to 5.
2. When we reach 5:
    - the number increases and becomes red.
    - the zoom button becomes unavailable for pressing.
3. When the counter value is 0: the reset button is disabled.
   The task is to perform using the knowledge gained in the course of training. Creating styles is a secondary task.

4. Add a settings management window.
5. The start and maximum values can be set.
6. When reloading the page, all values: in the counter, in the settings - do not change.
7. If the maximum value is less than the start value and the values are equal, then display an error and block the buttons
